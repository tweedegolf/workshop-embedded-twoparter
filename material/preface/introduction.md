# Introduction
Hello and welcome to Tweede golf's Embedded Rust Workshop! In this workshop, we'll get you started on writing your own embedded software using Rust.

The workshop is divided into two separate parts. Each part starts with us talking you through the material, introducing some concepts you'll need in order to complete an assignment. Of course, we'll be available for any questions and pointers and will.

Take a look at the [curriculum](/preface/curriculum.md) to get an idea of what's to come, and, in order to make sure everything worksh before the workshop starts, [**make sure you have followed the setup instructions**](/preface/setup.md).

Another means of preparing yourself is by reading up on the Rust language. If you want a quick introduction, read [A half-hour to learn Rust](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust). If you've got more time to spare, [The Rust Programming language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) or 'The Book', is a very thorough introduction to the language. For people who like interactive learning, be sure to give [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) a go. We will assume that you have some knowledge of the language before the workshop starts. Don't hesitate to ask any questions if something is not clear to you just yet, though.

The next sections of this site contain the material we'll discuss during the workshop. They contain links to sources and other explanations, so be sure to use them as reference.

Of course, there's also the workshop repository, which contains every file used in this workshop. [You can find it here](https://github.com/tweedegolf/workshop-december-2021).

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us.
